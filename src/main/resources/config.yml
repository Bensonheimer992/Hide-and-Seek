# This plugin by default functions as not tag to catch Hiders, but to pvp. All players are given weapons,
# and seekers slightly better weapons (this can be changed in items.yml). If you want, you can disable this
# entire pvp functionality, and make Hiders get found on a single hit. Hiders would also not be able to fight
# back against Seekers if disabled.
# default: true
pvp: true

# !! Only effects the game at all if pvp is set to false !!
# By default, If you disable pvp, Hiders and Seekers can no longer take damage from natural causes such as
# falling or projectiles. If you want, you can keep pvp disabled so that Seekers only have to tag Hiders, but
# all players can still take fall damage or any other damage that's not from another player.

# Players that join the server will automatically be placed into the lobby.

autoJoin: false

# (When autoJoin is false), when players join the world containing the lobby, they are automatically teleported
# to the designated exit position so that they don't spawn in the lobby while not in the queue. Anyone
# who ever joins in the game world (the duplicated world where the game is played) will always be teleported
# out regardless.
# default: false
teleportToExit: false

# Normally when the game ends, players are set back to the lobby to play another game.
# You can disable this, and empty the lobby after the game finishes. This is like everyone
# running /hs leave at the end of the game. Players will leave either to the exit position
# or another server depending on what you have `leaveType` set too.
# default: false

# What do you want to happen when a player leaves the lobby. If you are running a single server, maybe you want to send
# them to the world hub. But if you are running a bungee-cord or velocity server, maybe you want to send them to the servers'
# hub.
#
#   EXIT  - Sends the player to the specified exit position set by /hs setexit
#
#   PROXY - Send the player to a specified server in a bungee-cord / velocity setup.
#
# default: EXIT
leaveType: EXIT

# Ignore this setting if you aren't using the PROXY leave type method above. If you are, set this to the server you want to send
# players too.
leaveServer: hub

# By default, the plugin forces you to use a map save to protect from changes to a map thought a game play though. It copies your
# hide-and-seek world to a separate world, and loads the game there to contain the game in an isolated and backed up map This allows you to
# not worry about your hide-and-seek map from changing, as all changes are made are in a separate world file that doesn't get saved. Once the game
# ends, it unloads the map and doesn't save. Then reloads the duplicate to the original state, rolling back the map for the next game.
# It is highly recommended that you keep this set to true unless you have other means of protecting your hide-and-seek map.
# default: true
mapSaveEnabled: true

# By default, the plugin clears your inventory when joining the game. This is something it will always do. But you don't get what you used to have
# in your inventory back after you leave the game. You can allow the plugin to save a players inventory before joining the lobby, and give it back
# after leaving the game.
# default: false

# How you want to store game data. If you are running a single server, sqlite is fine, as no setup is necessary.
# But if you want the data to go across multiple servers, you can switch it to mysql.
# WARNING: Data is not saved across databases. You have to migrate the data yourself!
#
#   SQLITE - A single database.db file in the plugin folder, good for a single server.
#
#   MYSQL - Uses a mysql server to store data, good for multi-server setups or large servers.
#
# default: SQLITE
